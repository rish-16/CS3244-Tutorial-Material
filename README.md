# CS3244-Tutorial-Material
All supplementary material used by me while TA-ing CS3244: Machine Learning

## What is this?
I teach TG-06, the CS3244 tutorial that takes place every **Monday, 1200-1300** in AY21/22 Semester 1. It is *fully online* this semester.

This repository contains code, figures, and more that aid me in teaching my class. The main source of reference *should* be the lecture notes and tutorial questions created by the CS3244 Professors and Teaching Staff.
