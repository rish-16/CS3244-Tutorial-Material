# CS3244-Tutorial-Material
All supplementary material used by me while TA-ing **[CS3244: Machine Learning](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3244/machine-learning)** at NUS School of Computing.

## What is this?
I teach **TG-06**, the tutorial that takes place every **Monday, 1200-1300** in AY21/22 Semester 1. It is *fully online* this semester.

This repository contains code, figures, and miscelleaneous items that aid me in teaching my class. The main source of reference *should* be the lecture notes and tutorial questions created by the CS3244 Professors and Teaching Staff. 

> Official tutorial solutions will be released at the end of every week.
