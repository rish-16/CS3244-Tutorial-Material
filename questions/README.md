# Common Questions
Here's a list of questions compiled on the different topics asked during our QnA segment by students. I've organised them into a neat list sorted by the focus of the week. This could be of use during exam prep.

## Contents
Here's the list of topics covered during our sessions:

| **Topic**            | **File Name**      | **Tutorial** |
|----------------------|--------------------|--------------|
| k-Nearest Neighbours | `k-NN.md`          | T1W3         |
| Decision Trees       | `decision_tree.md` | T2W4         |

> This table and the different files will be incrementally updated as we progress together in CS3244.
